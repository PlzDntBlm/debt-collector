 ## Stealth
The player has to avoid conflict, since any direct confrontation with the goons will punish the player and make the game harder.
## Inventory Management
At any moment the player must be aware of what items to carry, since space is limited. A player may prefer to carry less tools to extract more loot or carry more items to manipulate the world.
## Time Awareness
To a thief time is of the essence, after all you can only steal so much in a single night. Guards may have a certain routine they adhere to and its useful to know where and when a goon stands duty.
