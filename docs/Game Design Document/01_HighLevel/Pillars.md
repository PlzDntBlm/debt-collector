## Stardew Valley
On their own accord the player may choose to avoid social interactions with NPCs altogether to focus on the farming core loop or build relationships with their fellow villagers.
Similarly, Spirit Conductor offers the option to only play the focused train conductor, maintaining the train, checking tickets and timetabling the daily routes, or the option to talk and interact with the deeper narrative of each individual commuter.
## Papers, Please
Spirit Conductor learns and adapts from Papers, Please's passport and paperwork review mechanics by implementing a similar system where the player has to check each passengers ticket for validity. Moral questions arise when the player has to choose between kicking fare evaders off the train or letting it slide at the expense of the player's finances.

## Commuting
Travelling by train in modern days may by many people experienced as a liminal space. They commute on a daily basis between home, work, school but stop registering the people they are surrounded by on their many journeys. We may sit cramped together but still isolate ourselves into our tiny bubbles. Spirit Conductor allows the player to register and process the people that surround them, turning blank slates into personas and true selves.
Besides the aspect of fellow travelers, the game deals with all the other different aspect of commuting: having valid/invalid tickets, hoping for the train to arrive in time, as well as finding the right seat.
